<p>Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/bloodglucose.html">blood glucose</a>, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html">hormone</a> made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.</p>

<p>If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/diabetescomplications.html">serious health conditions</a>. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.</p>

<p>There are different types of diabetes:</p>

<p>The different types of diabetes have different causes:</p>

<p>The different types of diabetes have different risk factors:</p>

<p>The symptoms of diabetes may include:</p>

<p>But it's important to know that your symptoms may vary, depending on which type you have:</p>

<p>To find out if you have diabetes, your health care provider will use one or more <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-glucose-test/">glucose blood tests</a>. There are several types, including the <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/a1c.html">A1C test</a>.</p>

<p>Treatment for diabetes involves managing your blood glucose levels:</p>

<p>Checking your blood glucose levels is also an important part of managing your diabetes. Ask your provider about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it.</p>

<p><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> can't be prevented.</p>

<p>You may be able to delay or prevent <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong> through the same lifestyle changes that are used to manage diabetes (eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity). These lifestyle changes may also help prevent <strong>gestational diabetes</strong>.</p>
